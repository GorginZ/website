      <description>November Readings WIP! Brave New World - Aldous Huxley . Aldous Huxley and Utopia (Prisms) - Theadore W.Adorno . See What You Made Me Do - Jess Hill

A Netflix documentary I watched recently follows a dad as he prepares for a launch, he was previously in the air force.</description>
