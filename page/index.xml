      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a DevOps Engineer. I like casual birdwatching in my local wetlands, and enjoy cooking, reading and swimming.
I studied history at Monash and have an interest in historical modes of production and transitory modes of production in particular. I worked as a swimming instructor previously but re-skilled as a software engineer following a spinal injury. I am interested in projects, communities and programs that increase accessability in tech, including how we work in tech.</description>
