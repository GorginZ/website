      <description>November Readings Brave New World - Aldous Huxley . Aldous Huxley and Utopia (Prisms) - Theadore W.Adorno . See What You Made Me Do - Jess Hill
Brave New World - Aldoux Huxley “Community, Identity, and Stability” this is the Brave New World&amp;rsquo;s answer to the radical bourgeois revolution, and only very few in the New World understand this deliciously illegal reference. The New World is some arrangement of highly centralised State Capitalism.</description>

      <description>October Readings The Martian - Andy Weir Mark Watney strikes readers as quite ordinary. We&amp;rsquo;re in his head, and it&amp;rsquo;s like our own, or rather his thoughts are similar to what we might share aloud with an ironic tone. I didn&amp;rsquo;t realize until recently most astronauts - at least American astronauts, are in fact ordinary people. A Netflix documentary I watched recently follows a dad as he prepares for a launch, he was previously in the air force.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a DevOps Engineer. I like casual birdwatching in my local wetlands, and enjoy cooking, reading and swimming.
I studied history at Monash and have an interest in historical modes of production and transitory modes of production in particular. I worked as a swimming instructor previously but re-skilled as a software engineer following a spinal injury. I am interested in projects, communities and programs that increase accessability in tech, including how we work in tech.</description>
