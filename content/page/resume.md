# Georgia Leng 

Devops Engineer

supporting production Kubernetes clusters

- providing outward facing service and education to extend and support developers 
- monitoring and alerting with Prometheus and Grafana 
- AWS networking
- linux
- Bash, Golang, Python, C#

things I value:

- automation is the norm, CI/CD practices. Confident with buildkite, gh actions and comfortable and happy learning new tools
- infrastructure as code and templating - cloudformation, gomplate, ktmpl for k8s. 
- team that is remote-first and can work and communicate together flexibly.
- learning culture and distributing knowledge across the team
- coding! devops isn't yaml hell, teams that put the dev in ops. 

Experience:

MYOB Associate DevOps Engineer

Currently in an exciting team that supports and extends an internal hosting platform with K8s as the backbone.

 - extend operaors written in python with a test driven approach to our work
 - wrote a library in Go as a learning project for a sister team that utilized the aws SSM sdk.
