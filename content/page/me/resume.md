# Georgia Leng 

Devops Engineer 

I have a background in history and are particularly interested in historical modes of production and transitory modes of production. I reskilled in tech following a serious spinal injury. I'm optimistic and enthusiastic. 

#### skills
- supporting production Kubernetes clusters
- providing outward facing service and education to extend and support developers, workshops, service-channel 
- extend and adjust our monitoring and alerting tools with Prometheus and Grafana 
- AWS: VPC networking, Cloudformation 
- linux
- Bash, Golang, Python, C#

#### things I value:

- automation is the norm, CI/CD practices. Confident with buildkite, gh actions and comfortable and happy learning new tools
- infrastructure as code and templating - cloudformation, gomplate, ktmpl for k8s. 
- team that is remote-first and can work and communicate together flexibly.
- learning culture and distributing knowledge across the team
- coding! devops isn't yaml hell, teams that put the dev in ops. 
- mentoring. I contribute to our graduate program through mentoring. 
- being mentored!
- blameless culture, if something got through, it got through everyone.
