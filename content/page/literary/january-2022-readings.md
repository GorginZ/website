### **Love's Work - Gillian Rose** 

Rose's *Loves Work* is a mémoire. There is Death - of loved ones, in Auschwitz, the indomitable. There is Family Trauma, Judaism, Prodestantism, Faith, Love, Cancer, The Work, a taste of regret.  
Rose's own death. 


Vulnerability 
Love
how did rose love?
that predatory woman she mentions, how did she 'love'?
Having loved Imperfectly is just what it is, but Rose steped away from the third, *the work*.

The work undone. Some that she stepped away from, but also work she was denied. 

Cancer

>“I asked Mr Wong, “What makes a man become a gynaecologist?” He replied, “Some men love women, and some men hate women”—no admission of unresolved equivocation in that taut response. And what makes a man become a specialist in gynaecological cancer (a field “invented” in the last twenty years)? He will always be breaking the bad news to individual women concerning their female anatomy. And what makes a man a specialist and co-author of the latest, standard textbook on ovarian cancer? Mr Wong answers pragmatically, “I was good with my hands but didn’t want to become an obstetrician like my father.” (82)


opinions on ovarian cancer are re-shared with us. We judge for ourselves from the varying meaning and quality of thought, *although I'd say they probably arrive in descending quality*.


>“I could compose a divan of divination, an anthology of aetiologies:

>>Camille Paglia (American author and media personality): “Nature’s revenge on the ambitious, childless woman.”

>>Braham Murray (theatre director, my first cousin): “Your inspiration poisoned at source”

>>John Petty (Provost of Coventry Cathedral and faith healer): “Transgenerational haunting and possession.”

>>Ian Florian (Principal, College of Traditional Acupuncture): “Imbalance of energies necessary for a woman to sustain success in the world.”

>Your betrayal twice by family; ancient, unacknowledged and unmourned dead; the philosophy of Hegel and Adorno; recent bereavements; the wrong kinds of relationship with men; too much whiskification; too little red wine and garlic. Hold on, I take garlic in my coffee…Well!” (84)

Rose does not dignify *alternative medicine* with any undue attention. Good. 


What's the current state of thought?

> "revealed religion, enlightenment rationalism, and postmodern relativism" (135)
