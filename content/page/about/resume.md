*Protégé Developer*, MYOB (August 2020 – April 2021)

MYOB’s graduate program: The Future Maker’s Academy prepares graduates to deliver value in product
teams

- refined foundational programming skills and best practices as outlined by FMA curriculum
- completed ‘phase 1 Quorum Review’ to demonstrate learnings (Language Design, OO principals,
TDD, source control.) Kata is presented to a panel of seniors to review
- completed ‘phase 2 Quorum Review to demonstrate CI practices. Greatly exceeded requirements
and found my love for DevOps:
- built API in C# without a framework and deployed it with an automated pipeline
(requirement)
- containerised and pushed artefacts to AWS ECR and internal CloudSmith repository
- all infrastructure for project deployed via AWS CloudFormation and was templated for
portability across environments
- separate test and ‘production’ environments
- AWS services used included: EC2 compute, VPC, VPC endpoints in conjunction with very
restrictive NaCLs and other associated networking, RDS, Application Load Balancer,
Route53, SSM parameter store and other adjacent services.
- Subsequently offered a rotation with the team that manages our internal hosting platform,
which landed me my next role at MYOB and introduced me to k8s
