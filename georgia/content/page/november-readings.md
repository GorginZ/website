*Aldous Huxley and Utopia (Prisms)* - **Theadore W.Adorno** . 
*See What You Made Me Do* - **Jess Hill**

### **Brave New World - Aldoux Huxley** 

 “Community, Identity, and Stability”, these are the principals of the next evolutionary development of what became of the society that followed the radical bourgeois revolution - not that anyone who exists in this Brave New World would understand this cheeky reference - as only very few are even aware of any history (that dangerous stuff) at all.

 Ford, Ford, Ford.


"the world is full of fathers and therefore, misery" 

Everyone Belongs to Everyone Else

Spending Is Better Than Mending

A Gram Is Better Than A Damn

***TODO the fake 'yes I hear him' orgy ***

I laughed a great deal, so many moments are just like our lives today.

***TODO find passage about there beingnothing to do alone/ in private ***

 I think only a text that details such banal horror can make me feel like this - somehow safer in the world. I'm not crazy - other people think it's ugly too.
